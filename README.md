The project: Brewhub Maps!  Find a brewery near you.

The website brings our thirty audience breweries across the U.S. 

The website includes the top 20 states with the most breweries.  
The website has easy to use map with functionality to assist in locating breweries.  
A user can quickly zoom in and zoom out, as well, as transverse the map and view the easy to spot markers.  Each marker lets the user know where a brewery is located. 
The marker comes with a hoover popup which will display:
•	Brewery Name
•	Brewery Type 
•	City location
•	Yelp Rating 
No need to open another browser to determine if this brewery is worth your time.  The popup has the Yelp rating.  The rating comes from the popular Yelp website in its familiar rate scoring. 


The problem our project is trying to solve is giving the audience a one-stop shop for brewery data for multiple locations across the United States. This can assist multiple industries from travel industry, entertainment industary and the small group events. Event planners can use the website to give travelers suggests for breweries. The website serves up brewery name, location and Yelp rates.
